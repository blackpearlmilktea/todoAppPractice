# todoAppPractice
The Master branch uses Jquery, Mustache, and Underscore to make a simple todo website that allows users to add items, mark them as complete, remove all completed items, and edit existing items' text.

The Backbone branch creates the same todo app as the master branch, but is coded with the Backbone framework. It also uses Local Storage so a todolist can be saved.
